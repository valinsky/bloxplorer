API Documentation
=================

The `Blockstream Esplora API <https://github.com/Blockstream/esplora/blob/master/API.md>`_ exposes 
multiple endpoints and methods associated with the following resources: 
`Transactions <https://github.com/Blockstream/esplora/blob/master/API.md#transactions>`_, 
`Addresses <https://github.com/Blockstream/esplora/blob/master/API.md#addresses>`_, 
`Blocks <https://github.com/Blockstream/esplora/blob/master/API.md#blocks>`_, 
`Mempool <https://github.com/Blockstream/esplora/blob/master/API.md#mempool>`_, 
`Fee estimates <https://github.com/Blockstream/esplora/blob/master/API.md#fee-estimates>`_ and 
`Issued assets <https://github.com/Blockstream/esplora/blob/master/API.md#issued-assets-elementsliquid-only>`_.

Bloxplorer is a Python wrapper around these resources and methods.

The explorers are instantiated with the following base urls:

* Bitcoin Explorer: https://blockstream.info/api/
* Liquid Explorer: https://blockstream.info/liquid/api/
* Bitcoin Testnet Explorer: https://blockstream.info/testnet/api/

After you import an explorer, you can use its methods by following this notation:

    >>> explorer.resource.method(*args, **kwargs)

Example:

    >>> bitcoin_explorer.blocks.get_blocks(start_height='587840')

All the available resource methods are documented below:
